Given Paper: Observation of Gravitational Waves from a Binary Black Hole Merger

Abstract: On September 14, 2015 at 09:50:45 UTC the two detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory simultaneously observed a transient gravitational-wave signal. The signal sweeps upwards in frequency from 35 to 250 Hz with a peak gravitational-wave strain of $1.0 \times 10^{-21}$. It matches the waveform predicted by general relativity for the inspiral and merger of a pair of black holes and the ringdown of the resulting single black hole. The signal was observed with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 24 and a false alarm rate estimated to be less than 1 event per 203 000 years, equivalent to a significance greater than 5.1 {\sigma}. The source lies at a luminosity distance of $410^{+160}_{-180}$ Mpc corresponding to a redshift $z = 0.09^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$. In the source frame, the initial black hole masses are $36^{+5}_{-4} M_\odot$ and $29^{+4}_{-4} M_\odot$, and the final black hole mass is $62^{+4}_{-4} M_\odot$, with $3.0^{+0.5}_{-0.5} M_\odot c^2$ radiated in gravitational waves. All uncertainties define 90% credible intervals.These observations demonstrate the existence of binary stellar-mass black hole systems. This is the first direct detection of gravitational waves and the first observation of a binary black hole merger.

Title: GW170608: Observation of a 19-solar-mass Binary Black Hole Coalescence

Abstract:   On June 8, 2017 at 02:01:16.49 UTC, a gravitational-wave signal from the
merger of two stellar-mass black holes was observed by the two Advanced LIGO
detectors with a network signal-to-noise ratio of 13. This system is the
lightest black hole binary so far observed, with component masses
$12^{+7}_{-2}\,M_\odot$ and $7^{+2}_{-2}\,M_\odot$ (90% credible intervals).
These lie in the range of measured black hole masses in low-mass X-ray
binaries, thus allowing us to compare black holes detected through
gravitational waves with electromagnetic observations. The source's luminosity
distance is $340^{+140}_{-140}$ Mpc, corresponding to redshift
$0.07^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$. We verify that the signal waveform is consistent with
the predictions of general relativity.

Title: Binary Black Hole Mergers in the first Advanced LIGO Observing Run

Abstract:   The first observational run of the Advanced LIGO detectors, from September
12, 2015 to January 19, 2016, saw the first detections of gravitational waves
from binary black hole mergers. In this paper we present full results from a
search for binary black hole merger signals with total masses up to $100
M_\odot$ and detailed implications from our observations of these systems. Our
search, based on general-relativistic models of gravitational wave signals from
binary black hole systems, unambiguously identified two signals, GW150914 and
GW151226, with a significance of greater than $5\sigma$ over the observing
period. It also identified a third possible signal, LVT151012, with
substantially lower significance, and with an 87% probability of being of
astrophysical origin. We provide detailed estimates of the parameters of the
observed systems. Both GW150914 and GW151226 provide an unprecedented
opportunity to study the two-body motion of a compact-object binary in the
large velocity, highly nonlinear regime. We do not observe any deviations from
general relativity, and place improved empirical bounds on several high-order
post-Newtonian coefficients. From our observations we infer stellar-mass binary
black hole merger rates lying in the range $9-240 \mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}
\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. These observations are beginning to inform astrophysical
predictions of binary black hole formation rates, and indicate that future
observing runs of the Advanced detector network will yield many more
gravitational wave detections.

Title: On the Gravitational Wave Background from Black Hole Binaries after the
  First LIGO Detections

Abstract:   The detection of gravitational waves from the merger of binary black holes by
the LIGO Collaboration has opened a new window to astrophysics. With the
sensitivities of ground based detectors in the coming years we can only detect
the local black hole binary mergers. The integrated merger rate can instead be
probed by the gravitational-wave background, the incoherent superposition of
the released energy in gravitational waves during binary-black-hole
coalescence. Through that, the properties of the binary black holes can be
studied. In this work we show that by measuring the energy density
$\Omega_{GW}$ (in units of the cosmic critical density) of the
gravitational-wave background, we can search for the rare $\sim 100 M_{\odot}$
massive black holes formed in the Universe. In addition, we can answer how
often the least massive BHs of mass $> 3 M_{\odot}$ form. Finally, if there are
multiple channels for the formation of binary black holes and if any of them
predicts a narrow mass range for the black holes, then the
gravitational-wave-background spectrum may have features that with the future
Einstein Telescope can be detected.

Title: GW151226: Observation of Gravitational Waves from a 22-Solar-Mass Binary
  Black Hole Coalescence

Abstract:   We report the observation of a gravitational-wave signal produced by the
coalescence of two stellar-mass black holes. The signal, GW151226, was observed
by the twin detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave
Observatory (LIGO) on December 26, 2015 at 03:38:53 UTC. The signal was
initially identified within 70 s by an online matched-filter search targeting
binary coalescences. Subsequent off-line analyses recovered GW151226 with a
network signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a significance greater than 5 $\sigma$.
The signal persisted in the LIGO frequency band for approximately 1 s,
increasing in frequency and amplitude over about 55 cycles from 35 to 450 Hz,
and reached a peak gravitational strain of $3.4_{-0.9}^{+0.7} \times 10^{-22}$.
The inferred source-frame initial black hole masses are $14.2_{-3.7}^{+8.3}
M_{\odot}$ and $7.5_{-2.3}^{+2.3} M_{\odot}$ and the final black hole mass is
$20.8_{-1.7}^{+6.1} M_{\odot}$. We find that at least one of the component
black holes has spin greater than 0.2. This source is located at a luminosity
distance of $440_{-190}^{+180}$ Mpc corresponding to a redshift
$0.09_{-0.04}^{+0.03}$. All uncertainties define a 90 % credible interval. This
second gravitational-wave observation provides improved constraints on stellar
populations and on deviations from general relativity.

Title: Observing gravitational-wave transient GW150914 with minimal assumptions

Abstract:   The gravitational-wave signal GW150914 was first identified on Sept 14 2015
by searches for short-duration gravitational-wave transients. These searches
identify time-correlated transients in multiple detectors with minimal
assumptions aboutthe signal morphology, allowing them to be sensitive to
gravitational waves emitted by a wide range of sources including binary
black-hole mergers. Over the observational period from September 12th to
October 20th 2015, these transient searches were sensitive to binary black-hole
mergers similar to GW150914 to an average distance of $\sim 600$ Mpc. In this
paper, we describe the analyses that first detected GW150914 as well as the
parameter estimation and waveform reconstruction techniques that initially
identified GW150914 as the merger of two black holes. We find that the
reconstructed waveform is consistent with the signal from a binary black-hole
merger with a chirp mass of $\sim 30 \, M_\odot$ and a total mass before merger
of $\sim 70 \, M_\odot$ in the detector frame.

Title: Properties of the Binary Black Hole Merger GW150914

Abstract:   On September 14, 2015, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave
Observatory (LIGO) detected a gravitational-wave transient (GW150914); we
characterize the properties of the source and its parameters. The data around
the time of the event were analyzed coherently across the LIGO network using a
suite of accurate waveform models that describe gravitational waves from a
compact binary system in general relativity. GW150914 was produced by a nearly
equal mass binary black hole of $36^{+5}_{-4} M_\odot$ and $29^{+4}_{-4}
M_\odot$; for each parameter we report the median value and the range of the
90% credible interval. The dimensionless spin magnitude of the more massive
black hole is bound to be $<0.7$ (at 90% probability). The luminosity distance
to the source is $410^{+160}_{-180}$ Mpc, corresponding to a redshift
$0.09^{+0.03}_{-0.04}$ assuming standard cosmology. The source location is
constrained to an annulus section of $610$ deg$^2$, primarily in the southern
hemisphere. The binary merges into a black hole of $62^{+4}_{-4} M_\odot$ and
spin $0.67^{+0.05}_{-0.07}$. This black hole is significantly more massive than
any other inferred from electromagnetic observations in the stellar-mass
regime.

Title: GWTC-1: A Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog of Compact Binary Mergers
  Observed by LIGO and Virgo during the First and Second Observing Runs

Abstract:   We present the results from three gravitational-wave searches for coalescing
compact binaries with component masses above 1$\mathrm{M}_\odot$ during the
first and second observing runs of the Advanced gravitational-wave detector
network. During the first observing run (O1), from September $12^\mathrm{th}$,
2015 to January $19^\mathrm{th}$, 2016, gravitational waves from three binary
black hole mergers were detected. The second observing run (O2), which ran from
November $30^\mathrm{th}$, 2016 to August $25^\mathrm{th}$, 2017, saw the first
detection of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star inspiral, in
addition to the observation of gravitational waves from a total of seven binary
black hole mergers, four of which we report here for the first time: GW170729,
GW170809, GW170818 and GW170823. For all significant gravitational-wave events,
we provide estimates of the source properties. The detected binary black holes
have total masses between $18.6_{-0.7}^{+3.2}\mathrm{M}_\odot$, and
$84.4_{-11.1}^{+15.8} \mathrm{M}_\odot$, and range in distance between
$320_{-110}^{+120}$ Mpc and $2840_{-1360}^{+1400}$ Mpc. No neutron star - black
hole mergers were detected. In addition to highly significant
gravitational-wave events, we also provide a list of marginal event candidates
with an estimated false alarm rate less than 1 per 30 days. From these results
over the first two observing runs, which include approximately one
gravitational-wave detection per 15 days of data searched, we infer merger
rates at the 90% confidence intervals of $110\, -\, 3840$
$\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{y}^{-1}$ for binary neutron stars and $9.7\, -\,
101$ $\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{y}^{-1}$ for binary black holes assuming fixed
population distributions, and determine a neutron star - black hole merger rate
90% upper limit of $610$ $\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{y}^{-1}$.

Title: The basic physics of the binary black hole merger GW150914

Abstract:   The first direct gravitational-wave detection was made by the Advanced Laser
Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory on September 14, 2015. The
GW150914 signal was strong enough to be apparent, without using any waveform
model, in the filtered detector strain data. Here, features of the signal
visible in the data are analyzed using concepts from Newtonian physics and
general relativity, accessible to anyone with a general physics background. The
simple analysis presented here is consistent with the fully
general-relativistic analyses published elsewhere,in showing that the signal
was produced by the inspiral and subsequent merger of two black holes. The
black holes were each of approximately 35 Msun, still orbited each other as
close as ~350 km apart, and subsequently merged to form a single black hole.
Similar reasoning, directly from the data, is used to roughly estimate how far
these black holes were from the Earth, and the energy that they radiated in
gravitational waves.

Title: Detecting Gravitational Waves With Disparate Detector Responses: Two New
  Binary Black Hole Mergers

Abstract:   We introduce a new technique to search for gravitational wave events from
compact binary mergers that produce a clear signal only in a single
gravitational wave detector, and marginal signals in other detectors. Such a
situation can arise when the detectors in a network have different
sensitivities, or when sources have unfavorable sky locations or orientations.
We start with a short list of loud single-detector triggers from regions of
parameter space that are empirically unaffected by glitches (after applying
signal-quality vetoes). For each of these triggers, we compute evidence for
astrophysical origin from the rest of the detector network by coherently
combining the likelihoods from all detectors and marginalizing over extrinsic
geometric parameters. We report the discovery of two new binary black hole
(BBH) mergers in the second observing run of Advanced LIGO and Virgo (O2), in
addition to the ones that were reported in Abbott et al. (2018) and Venumadhav
et al. (2019). We estimate that the two events have false alarm rates of one in
19 years (60 O2) and one in 11 years (36 O2).
  One of the events, GW170817A, has primary and secondary masses $m_1^{\rm src}
= 56_{-10}^{+16} \, M_\odot$ and $m_2^{\rm src} = 40_{-11}^{+10} \, M_\odot$ in
the source frame. The existence of GW170817A should be very informative about
the theoretically predicted upper mass gap for stellar mass black holes. Its
effective spin parameter is measured to be $\chi_{\rm eff} = 0.5 \pm 0.2$,
which is consistent with the tendency of the heavier detected BBH systems to
have large and positive effective spin parameters. The other event, GWC170402,
will be discussed thoroughly in future work.
